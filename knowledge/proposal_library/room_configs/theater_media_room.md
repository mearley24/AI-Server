# Room Config: Theater / Media Room / Home Cinema
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: The home theater is the crown jewel of many Symphony projects. Clients with theaters are often enthusiast buyers who have specific expectations. Know the basics of projection (throw ratio, screen size, gain), audio calibration, and acoustic treatment. Theater projects require a dedicated scoping conversation — do not spec a theater without understanding the room dimensions, ceiling height, and intended use (2-channel music vs. full Atmos cinema). -->

## TYPICAL SYSTEMS IN THIS ROOM

- Video display (projector + screen OR premium LED display)

- Seating (riser-mounted, powered recliners — out of scope but coordinate with designer)

## THEATER SCOPING NOTES FOR BOB

Before generating a theater proposal, confirm:
- **Room dimensions:** Width, depth, ceiling height. Minimum: 12' wide x 18' deep x 9' ceiling for projection.
- **Usage:** Primary movie theater (full blackout), or dual-use media room (also used with lights on)?
- **Screen size target:** Most clients want \"as big as possible\" — constrained by seating distance. Rule: 1.5x screen width = minimum viewing distance.
- **Audio ambition:** Background sound (stereo/5.1) or full Atmos (7.1.4)? Client's prior audio experience matters here.
- **Dedicated or multi-use?** Dedicated theater = in-wall speakers, fixed seating, full blackout. Media room = versatile, possibly open to other areas.

## COMMON CLIENT REQUESTS — THEATER

- **"How big of a screen can I fit?"** → Use room width and seating distance to determine: recommended screen width = seating distance / 1.5. A 15' viewing distance = 10' (120") screen width maximum. Adjust for ceiling height clearance.
- **"What's the difference between a media room and a real theater?"** → Media room: versatile, direct-view TV or projector, standard room acoustics, flexible seating. True theater: dedicated dark room, projection only, in-wall speakers, acoustic treatment, tiered seating. Investment difference: typically 2–3x.
- **"Can we add a 4K player for Blu-ray?"** → Yes — Sony UBP-X800M2 or Panasonic DP-UB9000 are the preferred recommendations. Always include if client has a physical media collection.
- **"Do we need acoustic panels?"** → Strongly recommended for dedicated theaters. Bare drywall creates flutter echo and bass buildup. Symphony provides acoustic treatment consultation referral for Best-tier projects.
- **"Can the theater system also play music?"** → Yes — any Atmos-capable AVR handles 2-channel music beautifully. In-wall speakers are particularly good for music at reference levels. Theater doubles as a 2-channel listening room.
