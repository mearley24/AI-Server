# Room Config: Dining Room
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: The dining room is a lighting-forward room. The chandelier is a focal point and Lutron dimming is essential. Shades for glare control during daytime dining are popular. AV is uncommon in formal dining rooms but occasionally requested. -->

## TYPICAL SYSTEMS IN THIS ROOM

- Lighting control (chandelier dimming is primary need)
- Motorized shades (for daytime glare control, privacy for evening)
- Audio (background music — optional, common in open-plan dining)
- Video (extremely rare in formal dining; more common in breakfast nook)
- Climate (zone sensor if near kitchen/open plan)

## COMMON CLIENT REQUESTS — DINING ROOM

- **"The chandelier buzzes when it dims"** → Common with non-compatible LED chandeliers. Solution: Lutron-compatible LED driver or replace fixture. Symphony will identify during pre-installation fixture review.
- **"Can we have candle-flicker mode?"** → Not natively in Lutron, but a slow random flicker scene can be approximated via Control4 and Lutron at very low dim levels. True candle effect usually means smart RGBW bulbs (like Philips Hue), which can be integrated separately.
- **"I want to control the lights from the dining table"** → Pico remote on the table or nearby surface mount is an elegant solution.
