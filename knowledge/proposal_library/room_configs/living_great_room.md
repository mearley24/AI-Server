# Room Config: Living Room / Great Room
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: The living/great room is the primary gathering space and often the showpiece of the smart home. Multi-zone audio, motorized shades, and a main display are core. The keypad in this room is the most visible and most-used in the home — make it a showcase piece. Coordinate with the interior designer on keypad placement and cover plate finishes. -->

## TYPICAL SYSTEMS IN THIS ROOM

- Lighting control (multi-circuit: recessed, accent, art lighting, fireplace accent)
- Motorized shades (primary windows — often the highest shade investment in the home)
- Audio (in-ceiling or in-wall speakers — primary entertainment zone)
- Video (main display / home theater adjacent — or combined in open-plan homes)
- Climate (thermostat or sensor visible from this zone)
- Control4 touch panel (this room typically has the most visible panel in the home)

## COMMON CLIENT REQUESTS — LIVING / GREAT ROOM

- **"Can we have a fireplace button?"** → Yes — if gas fireplace has a remote switch (most do), Control4 or Lutron keypad can control it. Fireplace on/off is one of the most popular automations.
- **"I want the shades to open at sunrise"** → Yes — astronomical clock in Control4. Shades open at local sunrise time automatically. Can be overridden manually.
- **"Movie mode — all from one button"** → Yes. The classic Control4 demo: one button = shades down, lights dim, TV on, Apple TV launches. Clients love it.
- **"Can we have different music in the great room vs. the kitchen?"** → Yes — separate audio zones. Great room and kitchen are independent but can be grouped for party mode.
- **"Can the outdoor speakers be linked to the great room?"** → Yes — patio/outdoor is a separate zone but can be grouped with great room for indoor/outdoor listening.
