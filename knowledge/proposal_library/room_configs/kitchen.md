# Room Config: Kitchen
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: The kitchen is one of the most-used rooms in the home and benefits significantly from smart control — especially under-cabinet audio, scene lighting, and TV visibility from the island. Clients often request "eyes and ears everywhere" in the kitchen. Coordinate with the interior designer on fixture specs before ordering Lutron dimmers. -->

## TYPICAL SYSTEMS IN THIS ROOM

- Lighting control (multi-circuit dimming, under-cabinet, island pendants, recessed)
- Motorized shades (over sink, breakfast area windows)
- Audio (in-ceiling speakers — kitchen is highest-use audio zone in most homes)
- Video (TV visible from island or breakfast nook — very common request)
- Climate (thermostat/sensor nearby)
- Intercom / doorbell viewing

## GOOD TIER — Essential

**Philosophy:** Smart dimming and music. The kitchen should at minimum have independent dimmer control and a speaker zone.

### Equipment

| Qty | Manufacturer | Model | Description |
|-----|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Lutron | RRD-6ND-WH (RadioRA 3) | Dimmer — overhead recessed main |
| 1 | Lutron | RRD-6ND-WH | Dimmer — island pendant lights |
| 1 | Lutron | RRST-W6A-WH | On/Off switch — under-cabinet LED (if not dimmable) |
| 1 | Lutron | RRLK-3BRL-WH | 3-button keypad (Morning, Cooking, All Off) |
| 2 | Polk Audio | RC80i | 8" in-ceiling speakers |

**Approx. Equipment Investment (Good):** $1,200 – $2,200

### Good Tier Notes
- No in-kitchen TV (optional upgrade)
- Audio from whole-home amplifier — kitchen is a zone on the Triad Eight/Sixteen
- Basic keypad scenes sufficient for most clients at this tier

- HomeWorks QSX provides processor-level reliability for the most-used room in the home

## COMMON CLIENT REQUESTS — KITCHEN

- **"I want to see the front door from the kitchen"** → Doorbell camera feed on the kitchen TV via Control4 driver (one button shows doorbell view).
- **"Can we have different lighting zones for the island vs. the rest of the kitchen?"** → Yes — each circuit (island pendants, overhead, under-cabinet) is a separate Lutron dimmer. Scene keypad manages them together.
- **"Can we have a recipe display on the kitchen TV while cooking?"** → Apple TV (or iPad on counter) works best for this. Control4 doesn't natively display recipes but can launch browser on Apple TV.
- **"I want music in the kitchen AND the patio at the same time"** → Kitchen and patio are separate audio zones; can be grouped in Control4 for synchronized playback.
- **"Can the under-cabinet lights be on a separate switch from the overhead?"** → Yes — always spec under-cabinet as a separate circuit from recessed/overhead.
