# Room Config: Entry / Foyer / Hallway
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: The entry is the first impression of the smart home. Lighting, camera visibility, and door station integration are the key features here. The entry keypad is often where a "Good Morning" / "Good Night" / "Leaving Home" scene lives. Pre-wire for a camera at the front door even if the camera is quoted separately. -->

- No audio in hallways standard (open plan hallways may be covered by adjacent room speakers)

## COMMON CLIENT REQUESTS — ENTRY

- **"I want the lights to come on automatically when I get home"** → Geofence + smart lock: When phone crosses geofence radius, trigger Welcome Home scene. Or: when deadbolt unlocked, trigger entry lights on.
- **"Can I see who's at the door from anywhere in the house?"** → Doorbell camera pop-up on all Control4 panels + app. Two-way audio from any panel.
- **"We have a housekeeper / dog walker — can we give them their own code?"** → Schlage Encode Plus and Yale Assure support multiple access codes. Each code can be logged via Control4 automation (push notification when specific code used).
- **"The foyer has a two-story chandelier — can you dim that?"** → Yes, with proper Lutron dimmer. Confirm chandelier has dimmable LED drivers or compatible dimming transformer. Chandelier installation by electrician.
