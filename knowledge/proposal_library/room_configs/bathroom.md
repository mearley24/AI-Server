# Room Config: Bathroom
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: Bathrooms are increasingly tech-forward spaces, especially master baths and spa bathrooms. Key systems: dimming (LED vanity compatibility is critical), motorized privacy shades, heated floor integration, and audio (steam and music is a very popular combination). Keep it concise — most bathrooms are simple. Master bath is the exception. -->

## TYPICAL SYSTEMS IN THIS ROOM

- Lighting control (vanity dimming, overhead, accent)
- Motorized privacy shade (window near tub/shower — critical for privacy)
- Audio (in-ceiling speakers — steam + music is popular)
- Climate / heated floor thermostat (if radiant floor)
- Steam shower integration (if applicable)
- Privacy (no cameras in bathrooms — ever)

## GOOD TIER — Essential

**Approx. Equipment Investment (Good):** $250 – $500

### Good Tier Notes
- Exhaust fan is always on/off — never on a dimmer

## COMMON CLIENT REQUESTS — BATHROOM

- **"I want to start the steam shower from bed"** → Mr. Steam ConnectPlus or ThermaSol integrated into Control4 — one button on the master BR Pico pre-heats the steam shower.
- **"Can the floor heat turn on before I wake up?"** → Yes — schedule or automation. Program 30 minutes before wake time, turn off 1 hour after.
- **"I don't want any bright lights in the middle of the night"** → "Night Light" scene at 5% for bathroom. Activated by motion sensor or programmed to activate automatically after midnight on a secondary keypad.
- **"The bathroom is too far from my bedroom — can I hear music in both?"** → Separate audio zone for master bath — independent volume control from whole-home system. Can be linked to "follow me" if client wants same music everywhere.
- **"No TV in the bathroom"** → Noted. Many clients ask, fewer actually add it. Waterproof bathroom mirror TVs (Séura, ProofVision) are available as Best tier add-ons but are niche.
