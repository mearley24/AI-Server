# Room Config: Outdoor / Patio / Covered Lanai / Pool Deck
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: Outdoor AV is one of the highest-value and most visually impressive additions to any project. Clients who have never experienced outdoor audio almost universally wish they had added it earlier. The key considerations are weatherproofing, landscape speaker placement, and screen visibility in daylight. Sell the experience: music by the pool, movies on the patio, sports on the outdoor TV. -->
