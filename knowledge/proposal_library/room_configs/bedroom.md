# Room Config: Bedroom (Secondary / Guest)

Tier selection typically follows the overall project tier, with a possible step-down from the master. Children's rooms may have unique requirements (noted below). -->

## CHILDREN'S ROOM NOTES

- **Dimmer type:** Lutron "Claro" style or standard paddle switch acceptable. Consider nightlight scene at 5–10% via Pico.
- **Shades:** Blackout strongly recommended for children's bedrooms — nap time and early wake-up management.
- **Audio:** In-ceiling speakers popular for bedtime music/white noise; program a "Sleep" scene that plays a calming playlist at low volume, then fades off after 45 minutes.
- **TV:** Many families prefer no TV in young children's rooms. If TV included, Control4 parental controls / schedule lockouts are available (TV access locked after bedtime).
- **Nightlight automation:** "Good Night" button on nightstand Pico dims to 5% (nightlight) for 30 minutes then turns off.
- **Future-proofing:** Pre-wire for TV even if not installing now — much easier during construction.

## COMMON CLIENT REQUESTS — SECONDARY BEDROOMS

- **"We want the guest room to be easy for guests who don't know our system"** → T4 panel with simple "Welcome" screen and labeled buttons; or program Pico remote with printed card explaining buttons.
- **"Can we lock the kids' TV at night?"** → Yes — Control4 "Lock/Unlock" function on AV devices by schedule or keypad.
- **"How many bedrooms need speakers?"** → Symphony recommends at minimum the master and any rooms used as an office or media space. Guest rooms optional.
- **"Do all bedrooms need to match?"** → No — many projects do master at Best, secondary bedrooms at Good or Better.
