# Room Config: Master Bedroom / Primary Suite
<!-- BOB INSTRUCTIONS: The master bedroom is one of the highest-value rooms in the smart home. Clients spend significant time here and value comfort, privacy, and ease-of-use above all. Blackout shades are almost always a must. The nightstand Pico remote is often described as one of the best quality-of-life features in the whole system. Design the automation around the client's daily routine: wake, sleep, and privacy. -->

## TYPICAL SYSTEMS IN THIS ROOM

## GOOD TIER — Essential

**Philosophy:** At minimum, the master bedroom should have dimming, blackout shades, and a Pico remote at the nightstand. These three items deliver the highest quality-of-life improvement per dollar.

### Good Tier Notes

- Blackout shades: standard expectation for master bedroom — include even at Good tier if possible
- No audio or AV at this tier (can be added as standalone option)
