Hi [CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

Thank you for the time you've invested in working with us — it's been a pleasure learning about [the project / your home / your vision for the space].

Attached is your Symphony Smart Homes proposal for **[PROJECT_NAME]**.

**What's inside:**

- A room-by-room scope of work for all [X] systems
- The complete equipment list with exact model numbers
- Labor timeline and project phases
- Full pricing summary with payment schedule
- Optional upgrades to consider

**A few things to highlight:**

[CUSTOM_HIGHLIGHT_1 — e.g., "We've specified Lutron RadioRA 3 lighting throughout — it's the most reliable system we install and it integrates natively with Control4."]

[CUSTOM_HIGHLIGHT_2 — e.g., "The theater build includes blackout shades and a Dolby Atmos configuration — this room is going to be something special."]

[CUSTOM_HIGHLIGHT_3 — e.g., "The network infrastructure is sized for today's devices plus room to grow — you'll never outgrow this system."]

**Questions?**

I'm happy to walk you through the proposal in detail — either by phone or at the property. Just reply to this email or call me at [PHONE_NUMBER].

**Next Steps:**

1. Review the attached proposal at your convenience
2. Let us know if you have questions or want to adjust scope
3. When you're ready to move forward, we'll send a contract and get a start date on the calendar

We're looking forward to building something exceptional for you.

Warmly,
