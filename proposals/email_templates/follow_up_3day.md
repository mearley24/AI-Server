## Email Body

Hi [CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

Just checking in — I sent over the proposal for [PROJECT_NAME] a few days ago and wanted to make sure it arrived and that you had everything you needed.

These proposals cover a lot of ground and I know reviewing them takes time. If anything is unclear, or if you'd like to talk through a specific section, I'm happy to jump on a call at your convenience.

A couple of things worth knowing:

- The proposal is valid for **30 days from [DATE]** — pricing is locked until then
- Equipment lead times for [KEY_EQUIPMENT] are currently running [LEAD_TIME] weeks, so earlier decisions give us more scheduling flexibility
- If you're considering any scope adjustments, it's easy to revise — just let us know what you're thinking

Would a 15-minute call work this week? I can walk you through the highlights in plain English.

Talk soon,

[SENDER_NAME]

## Usage Notes

- **KEY_EQUIPMENT:** Fill with 1–2 relevant items (e.g., "Control4 CORE 3 controllers," "Lutron RadioRA 3")
- **LEAD_TIME:** Check current supply chain — typical is 2–4 weeks; longer for custom orders
- **Tone:** Helpful, not pushy — this is a service check-in, not a sales push
- **If still no response at 7 days:** Send follow_up_7day.md
- **Personalize:** Add 1 specific line referencing the client's project (e.g., "I know we talked about the theater build — that's the piece I'd love to walk you through")
