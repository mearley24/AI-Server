## Email Body (Variant A — General)

---

Hi [CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

I don't want to be a pest — I know life gets busy and proposals can sit in the inbox. I'll keep this short.

The [PROJECT_NAME] proposal is still waiting whenever you're ready. If the timing isn't right, or if something has changed with the project, I'd genuinely appreciate knowing so I can plan accordingly.

And if you have questions — big or small, technical or not — I'm easy to reach.

Just reply here, or call [PHONE_NUMBER] whenever it's convenient.

Looking forward to working with you,

## Email Body (Variant B — Scope Adjustment Hook)

---

Hi [CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

Reaching out one more time on the [PROJECT_NAME] proposal.

I've been thinking about [SPECIFIC_ROOM_OR_SYSTEM] — a few things have come across my desk since we talked that might be worth a quick conversation. [e.g., "There's a new Lutron RadioRA 3 keypad aesthetic option that just launched — might be a better fit for your interior design direction."]

If the timing is off or priorities have shifted, no pressure at all. But if you're still moving forward, I'd love to reconnect.

## Email Body (Variant C — Pricing Expiry Notice)

*Use when proposal is approaching the 30-day expiry window*

---

Hi [CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

Quick heads-up — the [PROJECT_NAME] proposal pricing expires on **[EXPIRY_DATE]**.

After that date, I'll need to re-price the equipment list with current distributor pricing, which may result in changes (in either direction — some things have come down in price).

If you'd like to lock in the current pricing, just let me know and we'll move forward with a contract. If you need more time, I can note that you're still reviewing.

No pressure either way — I just wanted to give you advance notice.

## Usage Notes

- **Tone:** Keep it human. By day 7, you've earned the right to be a little more direct — but still warm.
- **Three variants:** Use A for standard no-response, B when you have a genuine update, C when pricing expiry is imminent
- **After day 7:** If still no response, mark lead as "dormant" in CRM and move to passive follow-up cadence (monthly check-in)
- **Do not:** Send more than 3 unsolicited follow-ups — respect the silence
