## Email Body

Hi [CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

We've received your signed contract and deposit — thank you. We're officially 
on the calendar for **[PROJECT_NAME]**, and we're excited to get to work.

Here's exactly what happens from here:

---

**Step 1 — Equipment Ordering (This Week)**

We're placing your equipment order with our distributors. Lead times for your 
specific items are currently running approximately [LEAD_TIME] weeks. 

Key equipment on order:
- [EQUIPMENT_1] — [LEAD_TIME] weeks
- [EQUIPMENT_2] — [LEAD_TIME] weeks
- [EQUIPMENT_3] — [LEAD_TIME] weeks

You'll receive confirmation once everything is received at our warehouse.

---

**Step 2 — Pre-Wire / Rough-In Scheduling**

Based on the construction schedule, your estimated pre-wire window is:

**Target Pre-Wire Date:** [DATE]  
**Rough-In Phase:** [DATE_RANGE]

We'll coordinate directly with [GC_NAME / your general contractor] to align 
with the construction schedule. If the timeline shifts, we'll adjust accordingly — 
just keep us looped in on any changes.

---

**Step 3 — Trim & Programming**

Once construction reaches trim stage, we'll be back for device installation, 
speaker placement, and system programming. This phase typically takes 
[X] days for a project of this scope.

**Estimated Trim/Programming Dates:** [DATE_RANGE]

---

**Step 4 — Commissioning & Walkthrough**

When systems are programmed and ready, we'll schedule a commissioning day with you. 
We'll walk through every scene, every zone, every interface — and make sure you're 
completely comfortable with your new system before we call it done.

**Estimated Commissioning:** [DATE]

**A Few Reminders**

- Please confirm with your GC that low-voltage blocking is scheduled before our pre-wire date
- Let us know if any room layouts or keypad locations change before rough-in
- If the construction schedule shifts significantly, please give us as much notice as possible — we'll work with it

Thank you again for trusting us with your home. We don't take that lightly.

We're going to build something you'll love.

Warmly,
