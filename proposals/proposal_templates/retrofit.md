## Section 2 — Executive Summary

[The executive summary belongs here. Retrofit proposals should acknowledge the 
existing system, explain what is being preserved vs. replaced, and describe the 
improved experience. See the Executive Summary Tone Guide in proposals.mdc.]

Example tone:

> The [CLIENT_NAME] residence already has a strong technology foundation — and 
> Symphony Smart Homes will build on it. This proposal outlines a targeted upgrade 
> that modernizes your [EXISTING_SYSTEM] while preserving the infrastructure 
> investments you've already made.
>
> Rather than starting over, we're elevating what works, replacing what's outdated, 
> and adding new capabilities that weren't available when your system was originally 
> installed. The result will be a dramatically improved experience delivered with 
> minimal disruption to your daily life.
>
> Our retrofit process is clean, efficient, and respectful of your home — we leave 
> every room exactly as we found it, just with better technology inside.
