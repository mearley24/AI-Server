## Sector Overview

Bookkeeping is the recurring revenue engine of the ClawWork operation. Once a client trusts Bob with their books, they come back monthly. A portfolio of 5 monthly bookkeeping clients at $200–400 each generates $1,000–2,000/month in fully predictable income — the foundation that makes variable task income less stressful.

**Bob's bookkeeping advantages:**
- Financial modeling experience from Symphony Smart Homes project accounting
- Familiarity with small business financial structures (sole prop, LLC, S-Corp)
- Chart of accounts design from multiple industry contexts
- Clean, professional financial report output
- Strong understanding of accrual vs. cash accounting

**Important:** Bob does NOT provide tax advice or CPA-level services. Every bookkeeping deliverable includes the disclaimer: *"Prepared for informational purposes. Consult a CPA for tax or compliance decisions."*

## Task Types

### 1. Monthly Bank Reconciliation
**What it looks like:**
- "Reconcile my business bank account for October — here's the statement and my QuickBooks export"
- "Clean up my books for Q3 — need everything matched"

**Bob's approach:**
1. Export transactions from both sources (bank statement + accounting software)
2. Match transactions line by line
3. Identify and categorize unmatched items:
   - **Outstanding checks:** issued but not cleared
   - **Deposits in transit:** received but not yet cleared
   - **Bank errors:** (rare) incorrect amounts or missing transactions
   - **Book errors:** transactions recorded in wrong amount or wrong account
4. Produce a reconciliation summary:
   - Opening balance
   - Transactions cleared
   - Ending balance (must match bank statement)
   - Unreconciled items with explanation
5. Flag any unusual transactions for client review

**Reconciliation report format:**
```
Bank Reconciliation — [Account] — [Month Year]

Bank Statement Balance (as of [date]):     $[X]
Less: Outstanding Checks:                  ($[X])
Plus: Deposits in Transit:                 $[X]
Adjusted Bank Balance:                     $[X]

Book Balance (per QuickBooks):             $[X]
Plus/Less: Book Adjustments:               $[X]
Adjusted Book Balance:                     $[X]

Difference (should be $0.00):              $[X]

Notes:
[Any unresolved items or flags for client]
```

**Time estimate:** 20–45 minutes depending on transaction volume  
**Rate target:** $75–200 per month

### 2. Expense Categorization
**What it looks like:**
- "Here's my 6 months of credit card statements — categorize everything by business category"
- "I've been sloppy about categorizing — clean up my books for Q1"

**Standard chart of accounts for small business:**

| Category | Common Transactions |
|----------|--------------------|
| Advertising & Marketing | Facebook ads, Google ads, marketing tools |
| Bank Fees & Charges | Monthly fees, wire fees, overdraft |
| Computer & Internet | Software subscriptions, hosting, internet |
| Equipment | Hardware purchases, tools |
| Insurance | Business, liability, professional |
| Meals & Entertainment | Client meals (50% deductible), team events |
| Office Supplies | Paper, ink, office materials |
| Professional Services | Accounting, legal, consulting |
| Rent & Utilities | Office space, utilities |
| Salaries & Wages | Payroll (own or contractors) |
| Travel | Business flights, hotels, transportation |
| Vehicle | Mileage, gas (business use) |

**Bob's categorization rules:**
1. When in doubt, err toward the more conservative (more specific) category
2. Flag personal-looking transactions for client confirmation
3. Document any assumptions made in categorization
4. Output: original transaction data + category column + notes column

**Time estimate:** 1–3 minutes per 10 transactions  
**Rate target:** $0.50–1.50 per transaction categorized; $60–150 for monthly batches

### 3. Financial Report Preparation
**What it looks like:**
- "Prepare a P&L for Q2 — here's my categorized expense data"
- "I need a simple cash flow summary for my accountant"
- "Create a month-over-month income report"

**P&L Template:**
```
[Business Name]
Profit & Loss Statement
[Period]

REVENUE
  Service Revenue:          $[X]
  Product Revenue:          $[X]
  Other Revenue:            $[X]
Total Revenue:              $[X]

COST OF GOODS SOLD
  Direct Labor:             $[X]
  Direct Materials:         $[X]
Total COGS:                 $[X]

*Prepared for informational purposes. Consult a CPA for tax or compliance decisions.*
```

**Time estimate:** 20–60 minutes  
**Rate target:** $100–250 per report

### 4. QuickBooks Cleanup
**What it looks like:**
- "My QuickBooks is a mess from years of inconsistent categorization — can you clean it up?"
- "I need my books audit-ready by end of month"

**Approach:**
1. Export all transactions to CSV
2. Identify and document all inconsistencies:
   - Duplicate transactions
   - Uncategorized transactions
   - Miscategorized transactions (obvious ones)
   - Missing months
3. Provide a cleanup plan with time and cost estimate before proceeding
4. Execute cleanup in batches with client sign-off at each stage

**Note:** This is a high-value task but requires clear scope agreement upfront. Never start a cleanup without a written scope.

**Rate target:** $150–400+ depending on scope

## Recurring Client Strategy

The goal is monthly retainer clients. Here's the conversion playbook:

1. **First engagement:** Take a one-off reconciliation or cleanup task
2. **Deliver 10% ahead of deadline** with a clean, professional report
3. **After delivery, offer the retainer:**
   *"If you'd like ongoing monthly reconciliation and categorization, I can keep your books clean on a retainer basis. Typically $[X]/month depending on transaction volume. Would that be helpful?"*
4. **Retainer pricing:**
   - 0–100 transactions/mo: $150/mo
   - 101–300 transactions/mo: $225/mo
   - 301–600 transactions/mo: $325/mo
   - 600+ transactions/mo: $400+/mo
5. **After 3 months, upsell:** "Would you like me to also handle your accounts receivable tracking?"
