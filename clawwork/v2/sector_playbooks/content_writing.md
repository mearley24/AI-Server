## Content Types and Templates

### 1. Blog Posts
**Target:** 500–1,500 words  
**Rate:** $40–120 per post  
**Time:** 20–40 minutes

**Standard structure:**
```
H1: [Primary keyword] — [Value proposition]

Intro (100–150 words):
- Hook: stat, question, or bold claim
- Context: why this matters now
- Preview: what the reader will learn

H2: [Section 1] (200–300 words)
H2: [Section 2] (200–300 words)  
H2: [Section 3] (200–300 words)
[Additional H2s as needed]

Conclusion (100–150 words):
- Summarize key takeaways
- Clear CTA (subscribe, contact, download)
```

**SEO checklist (for SEO-optimized posts):**
- [ ] Primary keyword in H1, first paragraph, one H2, and meta description
- [ ] 2–3 secondary keywords distributed naturally
- [ ] Internal linking placeholder noted ("[INTERNAL LINK: related post]")
- [ ] Image alt text written if images are requested
- [ ] Meta description: 150–160 characters, includes primary keyword

### 2. LinkedIn Articles
**Target:** 700–1,200 words  
**Rate:** $50–100 per article  
**Time:** 25–40 minutes

**Structure:**
- Hook (first 2 lines visible before "see more") — critical for engagement
- Subheadings in **bold** (LinkedIn doesn't support H tags in articles)
- Short paragraphs (2–3 sentences max)
- Bulleted takeaways
- First-person professional voice
- CTA at end: invite comments or connections

**Tone:** Authoritative but personal. Not corporate jargon. Written as if by a senior professional sharing genuine insight.

---

### 3. Email Newsletters
**Target:** 300–600 words  
**Rate:** $35–80 per newsletter  
**Time:** 15–25 minutes

**Structure:**
```
Subject line: [benefit-driven, <50 chars]
Preview text: [expands subject, 85–100 chars]

Opening: Personal greeting + one engaging sentence
Body: 2–3 short sections with clear headers
Closing: Warm sign-off + clear single CTA
P.S.: Optional — often has highest read rate
```

**Subject line formulas (rotate to avoid fatigue):**
1. Number + benefit: "5 ways to cut your utility bill this winter"
2. Question: "Is your smart home actually saving you money?"
3. News hook: "What the new smart home tax credit means for you"
4. Curiosity gap: "The one thing most homeowners overlook (and regret)"

---

### 4. Product Descriptions
**Target:** 100–300 words per product  
**Rate:** $5–25 per description (volume pricing)
**Time:** 5–10 minutes per description

**Formula:**
1. **Lead with the benefit**, not the feature ("Sleep better tonight" not "Has 12 sleep modes")
2. List 3–5 bullet-point features with micro-benefits
3. Social proof hook if available ("Trusted by 10,000+ homeowners")
4. Clear CTA ("Add to cart", "Get yours today")

**Bob's advantage:** Smart home and AV product descriptions are a specialty. Deep technical knowledge = no research overhead.

---

### 5. Case Studies
**Target:** 600–1,200 words  
**Rate:** $75–200 per case study  
**Time:** 30–60 minutes

**Standard structure (Problem → Solution → Results):**
```
Title: How [Client Type] [Achieved Outcome] with [Product/Service]

Challenge (150–200 words):
- Context: who is the client, what situation were they in
- Problem: specific pain point with quantification

Solution (200–300 words):
- What was implemented
- Key features/steps
- Timeline

Results (150–200 words):
- Quantified outcomes (%, $, time)
- Quote from client if available
- Before/after comparison table

Conclusion (100 words):
- Implications
- CTA: get similar results
```

## Writing Quality Standards

### Voice and Tone
- **Professional, not corporate.** Clear, direct, human.
- **Active voice > passive.** "The team built the system" not "The system was built by the team."
- **No filler phrases.** Delete: "In conclusion," / "It is important to note" / "Needless to say"
- **Vary sentence length.** Short for emphasis. Longer for explanation and depth.
- **Transitions are structure.** Use transitional phrases to guide the reader, not headers alone.

### Editing checklist:
- [ ] First sentence hooks immediately (no slow warmup)
- [ ] Every paragraph has a clear point
- [ ] No paragraph longer than 5 lines
- [ ] No sentence longer than 30 words
- [ ] Active voice dominates
- [ ] No obvious AI filler phrases
- [ ] Consistent tense throughout
- [ ] CTA is specific and actionable

## Platform Tactics

### Upwork
- Build a portfolio with 3–5 samples (smart home blog, real estate newsletter, tech article)
- Target $0.10–$0.15 per word for blog posts ($100–150 per 1,000-word article)
- Apply to "ongoing content" contracts — more stable than one-off projects
- Niche positioning: "Tech-focused content writer for real estate and smart home brands"

### WriterAccess
- Create profile emphasizing tech, real estate, and B2B niches
- Aim for 4–5 star rating to unlock higher-rate projects
- Complete "Casting" assignments to get discovered by enterprise clients

### Contently
- Portfolio-first platform — quality of samples determines access to premium clients
- Upload 3–5 best pieces with strong metrics if available
- Rates typically $150–500 per piece at premium tier

## When to Decline

- Projects requiring personal interviews or primary source reporting (Bob cannot conduct interviews)
- Projects requiring "I" first-person voice as a named human author (ghostwriting is fine; attributed byline is not)
- Projects where the client has already written "most of it" and wants editing — editing pays poorly for the time; decline unless rate is $75+/hr equivalent
