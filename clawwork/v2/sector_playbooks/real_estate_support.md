## Sector Overview

Real estate support is one of Bob's highest-fit sectors. Symphony Smart Homes serves RE professionals extensively — Bob knows property tech, MLS systems, transaction timelines, agent workflows, and the language of the industry. RE clients are also sticky: they come back for listing after listing, market report after market report.

**Strategic priority:** Find 1–2 RE brokerages or teams who need recurring support. A single RE brokerage relationship can mean $300–800/month in steady work.

## Task Types

### 1. Listing Descriptions
**What it looks like:**
- "Write a compelling listing description for this 4BD/3BA home in Scottsdale"
- "Create a luxury description for this $2.5M waterfront property"
- "Rewrite this listing — it's too boring, needs more energy"

**Bob's approach:**

**Formula: Lead with lifestyle, support with features, close with urgency**

```
Opening hook (1–2 sentences):
- Lifestyle or emotion, not square footage
- "Wake up to panoramic mountain views..." not "This 2,400 sqft home..."

Property highlights (3–5 sentences):
- Kitchen, master suite, outdoor space, unique features
- Use specific details (quartz countertops, not just "upgraded kitchen")

Location value (1–2 sentences):
- Walkability, schools, neighborhood feel, distance to key destinations

Close (1 sentence):
- Urgency or exclusivity: "This won't last." / "Schedule your private showing today."
```

**Luxury listings** require elevated vocabulary:
- "Gourmet kitchen" not "nice kitchen"
- "Primary suite" not "master bedroom" (modern standard)
- "Curated finishes" not "nice finishes"
- "Serene backyard retreat" not "big backyard"

**Word count targets:**
- Standard MLS description: 150–250 words
- Premium/luxury: 250–400 words
- Full marketing description: 400–600 words

**Time estimate:** 10–20 minutes per listing  
**Rate target:** $25–60 per listing; $150–400 for a batch of 10+

---

### 2. Market Reports
**What it looks like:**
- "Create a monthly market report for the Phoenix East Valley for December 2025"
- "Write a neighborhood report for buyers considering Scottsdale"
- "Summarize the Q3 2025 commercial real estate market"

**Standard structure:**
```
Title: [Area] Real Estate Market Report — [Month Year]

1. Market Snapshot (table or bullets)
   - Median sale price
   - Days on market
   - Active listings
   - Sale-to-list ratio
   - Month-over-month change

2. What Buyers Need to Know (150–200 words)
   - Competitive conditions
   - Mortgage rate context
   - Best opportunities right now

3. What Sellers Need to Know (150–200 words)
   - Pricing strategy
   - Market timing
   - Preparation tips

4. Neighborhood Spotlight (optional, 100–150 words)
   - One neighborhood deep-dive

5. Outlook (100–150 words)
   - 30–90 day expectation
```

**Data sources:**
- Realtor.com / Zillow market stats (publicly available)
- MLS data if client provides
- Local news for context (rate changes, economic indicators)

**Time estimate:** 30–60 minutes  
**Rate target:** $75–200 per report

---

### 3. CMA Support (Comparative Market Analysis)
**What it looks like:**
- "Help me write the narrative section of this CMA"
- "Organize these comparables into a clean table format"
- "Write a client-friendly summary of why we're pricing at $X"

**Bob's approach:**
1. If comps are provided: organize into a table (address, sqft, bed/bath, sale price, $/sqft, DOM)
2. Write a narrative that explains the pricing logic in plain English
3. Highlight the two or three most comparable sales and explain their relevance
4. Note any adjustments made (upgrades, condition, lot size)

**Time estimate:** 20–40 minutes  
**Rate target:** $50–125

---

### 4. Email and Newsletter Content
**What it looks like:**
- "Write my monthly client newsletter"
- "Create a drip email sequence for new buyer leads"
- "Write a just-listed announcement email"

**Just-listed email template:**
```
Subject: Just Listed: [Address] — [Headline Feature]

**Rate target:** $50–150 for template/checklist creation

**Outreach message template:**
```
Subject: Real estate content support — listings, market reports, email

Hi [Name],

I work with RE teams providing listing descriptions, market reports, and email content.

I've worked extensively in smart home and property tech, so I know the industry and 
its language. I deliver fast (typically same-day), and I'm happy to do a sample 
listing or report for free so you can evaluate quality before committing.

Is this something you'd find useful?
