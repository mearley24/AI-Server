- Target: ongoing CS contracts (monthly retainer or hourly engagement)

### Fiverr
- Gig: "I will write professional customer support email responses"
- Packages: 5 emails ($25), 15 emails ($60), 30 emails ($100)
- Upsell: "Add a help center article template for $25 extra"

## Quality Standards

| Dimension | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Empathy | Every response acknowledges the customer's frustration before solving |
| Clarity | The solution or next step is unmistakably clear |
| Tone | Warm but professional; not robotic or corporate |
| Speed | Template-based responses: <3 min each; custom: <8 min each |
| Completeness | Every response answers the question; no "maybe" closings |
| CTA | Every response ends with a clear next step or open door for follow-up |

**Rule:** Never let response quality slip for volume. A 0.70-quality CS submission damages the platform profile more than a slow delivery.
