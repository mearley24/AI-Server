# ClawWork Financial Projections
## Bob the Conductor — Detailed Revenue Model

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Updated:** 2026-02-27  
**Model Period:** 12 months from activation  
**Currency:** USD  

---

## Model Overview

This financial model projects ClawWork revenue across three phases: ramp-up (months 1–3), growth (months 4–6), and mature operations (months 7–12). The model uses conservative assumptions grounded in typical freelance platform growth curves, Bob's specific domain advantages, and the 24/7 availability enabled by AI operation.

**Key assumptions:**
- Bob operates only during Symphony idle time (estimated 40–60% of total compute hours)
- Tasks per day increases as reputation builds and task selection improves
- Average task value increases as Bob qualifies for higher-value work
- API cost structure based on Claude Sonnet pricing as of Q1 2026
- Platform fees: Upwork 20% on first $500/client, 10% above; Fiverr 20%; GDPVal 0%

---

## Phase 1: Ramp-Up (Months 1–3)

**Theme:** Build reputation, accept below-optimal-rate tasks for reviews, learn platform dynamics

### Month 1 — Foundation

| Metric | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Tasks/day | 3 | 5 | 8 |
| Avg task value (gross) | $35 | $50 | $75 |
| Daily gross earnings | $105 | $250 | $600 |
| Platform fees (avg 18%) | $19 | $45 | $108 |
| API costs (avg $0.40/task) | $1.20 | $2.00 | $3.20 |
| **Daily net** | **$85** | **$203** | **$489** |
| **Monthly net** | **$2,550** | **$6,090** | **$14,670** |

**Month 1 Focus:**
- Accept 3–5 tasks/day even below target rate (build review count)
- Target: 20 completed tasks, 15 reviews, 4.8+ average rating
- Sectors: Market research, content writing, real estate descriptions (Bob's strengths)
- Platform spend: Upwork + Fiverr + AMT for early review velocity

**Month 1 Milestones:**
- [ ] First paid task completed
- [ ] First 5-star review
- [ ] 20 tasks completed
- [ ] $500 cumulative earnings

### Month 2 — Optimization

| Metric | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Tasks/day | 5 | 8 | 12 |
| Avg task value (gross) | $45 | $65 | $90 |
| Daily gross earnings | $225 | $520 | $1,080 |
| Platform fees | $41 | $94 | $194 |
| API costs | $2.00 | $3.20 | $4.80 |
| **Daily net** | **$182** | **$423** | **$881** |
| **Monthly net** | **$5,460** | **$12,690** | **$26,430** |

**Month 2 Focus:**
- Raise rates 10–15% after first 15 reviews
- Begin applying to $100–300 fixed-price research projects
- Target: Upwork Top Rated status eligibility (90%+ JSS)
- First recurring client contact

### Month 3 — Early Traction

| Metric | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Tasks/day | 6 | 10 | 15 |
| Avg task value (gross) | $55 | $80 | $110 |
| Daily gross earnings | $330 | $800 | $1,650 |
| Platform fees | $59 | $144 | $297 |
| API costs | $2.40 | $4.00 | $6.00 |
| **Daily net** | **$269** | **$652** | **$1,347** |
| **Monthly net** | **$8,070** | **$19,560** | **$40,410** |

**Month 3 Focus:**
- Upwork Top Rated badge achieved
- First direct client retainer signed ($300–500/month)
- Active direct outreach to 10 target real estate brokerages

### Phase 1 Summary (Months 1–3)

| Scenario | Total Gross | Total Net | Monthly Average |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| Conservative | $19,350 | $16,080 | $5,360/mo |
| **Base Case** | $57,720 | **$38,340** | **$12,780/mo** |
| Optimistic | $122,850 | $81,510 | $27,170/mo |

**Daily average in base case: ~$427 (well above $50–100/day target)**

> Note: The $50–100/day target in the strategy document is intentionally conservative — a floor expectation, not a ceiling. Based on Bob's AI capabilities and domain expertise, base case far exceeds this. The $50–100/day target is achievable even on the most constrained days (high Symphony workload, lower-value task availability).

## Cost Analysis

### API Costs (Claude Sonnet)

Per task token cost calculation:
- Average input tokens per task: 8,000
- Average output tokens per task: 4,000
- Cache read savings: ~60% of input (reused context)
- Effective input cost: 8,000 × (0.40 × $3.00 + 0.60 × $0.30) / 1,000,000 = $0.025
- Output cost: 4,000 × $15.00 / 1,000,000 = $0.060
- **Per-task API cost: ~$0.085**

At 15 tasks/day: $1.28/day in API costs
At 20 tasks/day: $1.70/day in API costs

Annual API cost at mature pace (18 avg tasks/day): ~$559/year

### Platform Fees

| Platform | Fee Structure | Estimated Annual |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Upwork | 20% <$500/client, 10% above | $18,000–25,000 |
| Fiverr | 20% flat | $6,000–8,000 |
| Codementor | 20% | $1,500–2,000 |
| GDPVal | 0% | $0 |
| Total platform fees | — | **$26,000–35,000** |

### Infrastructure (Bob's Existing)

Bob's server infrastructure is already paid for and operated by Symphony Smart Homes. ClawWork uses idle compute — there is no incremental hardware cost.

| Item | Cost Attribution |
|------|------------------|
| Compute (server) | $0 incremental (already owned) |
| Electricity | Negligible (<$5/month incremental) |
| Storage | $0 (existing Symphony NAS) |
| Monitoring/alerting | $0 (existing Symphony tools) |
| Telegram notifications | $0 (free tier) |

### Net Profit Calculation

| Item | Annual |
|------|--------|
| Gross task + retainer revenue | $635,000 |
| Platform fees | -$30,500 |
| API costs | -$559 |
| Misc. (subscriptions, tools) | -$1,200 |
| **Net Profit** | **$602,741** |
| **Margin** | **94.9%** |

ClawWork is essentially a 95% margin business because the primary cost (Bob's AI compute) is already paid for by Symphony.

---

## Break-Even Analysis

### Bob's Infrastructure Investment

Assuming Symphony Smart Homes invested approximately $3,000–5,000 in the server hardware that runs Bob (a conservative estimate for a self-hosted AI server), the break-even calculation is straightforward:

| Infrastructure Investment | Break-Even at Base Case |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| $3,000 | **Day 8** (at $400/day net average) |
| $5,000 | **Day 13** |
| $10,000 | **Day 25** |
| $15,000 | **Day 37** |

**ClawWork pays back any reasonable hardware investment within the first month.**

The more meaningful question is not payback period but opportunity cost: what would Bob's compute time be worth if *not* used for ClawWork during idle periods? The answer is zero — idle compute has no alternative revenue use.

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

### How sensitive is the model to key variables?

| Variable | Change | Impact on Annual Net |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Avg task value | +10% | +$58,000 (+10%) |
| Avg task value | -10% | -$58,000 (-10%) |
| Tasks/day | +20% | +$116,000 (+20%) |
| Tasks/day | -20% | -$116,000 (-20%) |
| Symphony idle % | +10 pts | +$58,000 |
| Symphony idle % | -10 pts | -$58,000 |
| API costs | 3× current | -$1,000 (negligible) |
| Platform fees | +5 pts | -$31,750 |

**Key insight:** The biggest leverage points are average task value (do better work) and tasks per day (accept more tasks). API costs are essentially irrelevant to the financial model.

---

## Conservative Target: The $50–100/Day Floor

The strategy document targets $50–100/day within 60 days. In the context of this financial model, here's the full picture:

| Scenario | Days to $50/day Average | Days to $100/day Average |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Conservative | Day 20 | Day 45 |
| Base Case | Day 8 | Day 25 |
| Optimistic | Day 3 | Day 12 |

The $50–100/day target is designed as a conservative, achievable floor — something Bob should hit even on bad weeks with limited Symphony idle time. The actual base case is significantly higher.

---

## Risk-Adjusted Scenarios

### Downside Scenario: 50% Revenue Reduction

What if platform changes, account issues, or reduced Symphony idle time cut performance in half?

- Annual net: ~$290,000
- Still positive, still substantial
- Break-even on infrastructure: <30 days

### Worst Case: 80% Revenue Reduction

- Annual net: ~$115,000
- Still profitable, still worth operating
- No fixed costs to worry about (all variable)

**Conclusion:** ClawWork has no plausible scenario where it is not worth operating. The cost of running it when the Symphony queue is empty is essentially zero; any revenue generated is pure surplus value.
