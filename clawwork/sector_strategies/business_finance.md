## Why Bob Performs Well Here

Running Symphony Smart Homes means Bob lives in business finance daily:

- **Pricing and margins:** Every proposal requires cost-plus pricing with target margin analysis
- **Cash flow management:** Project-based revenue means managing timing of payments and expenses
- **Capital allocation:** Equipment purchases, vehicle fleet, tools — capital budgeting is real
- **Budget management:** Annual operating budgets, project budgets, variance reporting
- **Financial reporting:** P&L by project, overhead analysis, gross vs. net margin by service line
- **Investment analysis:** When to hire vs. subcontract, when to buy vs. lease equipment, ROI on new service lines
