# Proposal & Quote Rules

## Purpose

These rules govern how Claude assists with writing client proposals, generating equipment quotes, and structuring project estimates for Symphony Smart Homes.

## Proposal Structure

Every Symphony proposal must follow this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** — 1 paragraph, non-technical, benefit-focused.
2. **Scope of Work** — bullet list of deliverables, room by room if applicable.
3. **Equipment List** — table with columns: Item, Make/Model, Qty, Unit Price, Total.
4. **Labor Estimate** — hours by task category (design, installation, programming, training).
5. **Total Investment** — hardware + labor + tax (8.81% for Colorado) + optional annual service plan.
6. **Timeline** — milestone table with estimated dates.
7. **Terms** — standard 50% deposit, balance on completion; 1-year warranty on labor.

## Pricing Guidelines

- Equipment: street price × 1.35 (35% margin) unless the client has a negotiated rate.
- Labor: $185/hr for standard, $245/hr for programming/design.
- Annual service plan: 12% of total hardware value per year.
- Always show prices ex-tax and then a separate tax line.

## Tone

- Professional and confident — this is a premium service.
- Avoid the word "cheap" — use "cost-effective" or "value-optimised".
- Avoid overpromising — "typically" and "estimated" are fine; absolute guarantees are not.

## D-Tools Integration

When a D-Tools project export is available, pull equipment lists and room data directly from the CSV rather than entering manually. Validate model numbers against the D-Tools export before including in a proposal.
