# Audio System Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### No Sound
1. Confirm the amplifier or receiver is powered on.
2. Verify the correct input source is selected (TV, Streaming, Vinyl, etc.).
3. Check that zone volume is not at zero — look for a zone-volume control on the app or keypad.
4. Ensure speaker cables are firmly connected at both the amplifier and speaker terminals.
5. If using a Control4 or Lutron audio zone: check the Control4 app shows the zone as "Active".

### Distorted or Crackling Audio
1. Check all speaker cable connections for loose strands that might be causing a short.
2. Reduce volume to 50% — if distortion disappears at lower levels, the amplifier may be underpowered for those speakers.
3. Switch to a different source — if distortion is only on one source, the cable or output of that source is the issue.
4. For whole-home audio (Sonos, Control4 audio): restart the source player via the app.

### Audio Cutting Out
1. For wireless speakers (Sonos, Bluetooth): check Wi-Fi signal strength at the speaker location.
2. For Sonos: open the Sonos app → Settings → System → and run a network diagnostic.
3. For wired zones: check for a loose connection at the amplifier's zone output terminals.

## Escalation Criteria

Schedule a technician if:
- Distortion persists after all steps above.
- A zone is completely dead with no audio at any volume.
- Physical damage to speakers or cables is visible.
- The amplifier displays an error code.
