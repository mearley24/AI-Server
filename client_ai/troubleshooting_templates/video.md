# Display & Video Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### No Picture / Black Screen
1. Confirm the display is powered on and the correct HDMI input is selected.
2. If "No Signal" appears: re-seat the HDMI cable at both ends — a loose connection is the most common cause.
3. If the screen is black with no "No Signal" message: this is often an HDCP handshake failure.
   - Power off both the display and the source device.
   - Wait 30 seconds.
   - Power on the **source device first**, then the display.
4. For displays in a video matrix: check the matrix app or touchscreen to confirm the correct source is routed to that room.

### Wrong Resolution or Aspect Ratio
1. On the source device (Apple TV, streaming box, laptop), navigate to display settings and set the output resolution to **1080p** as a baseline test.
2. If the display shows black bars: check the aspect ratio setting on both the source and the display's own menu.
3. For 4K displays: ensure the HDMI cable is Premium High Speed (18 Gbps rated) — standard cables will cap at 1080p.

### Image Quality Issues (fuzzy, colour issues)
1. Try a different HDMI cable — degraded cables cause colour and sharpness issues.
2. Check the display's picture mode — it may have been changed to a low-quality preset.
3. For projectors: check if the lens needs cleaning or the lamp hours are approaching end-of-life (visible in projector menu).

### Display Randomly Turning Off
1. Check the display's sleep/auto-off setting — it may be set to turn off after 15–30 minutes of inactivity.
2. For Control4-managed displays: check if a "display off" scene or schedule is triggering unexpectedly.
3. If the display turns off immediately after powering on: it may be overheating — ensure adequate ventilation around the unit.

## Escalation Criteria

Schedule a technician if:
- HDCP errors persist after power-cycling both source and display.
- A display in a video matrix is not routing correctly after troubleshooting.
- Physical damage to the display, mount, or cables is present.
- A projector lamp needs replacement.
